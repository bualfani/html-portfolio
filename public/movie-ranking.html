<h1>The Best Animes</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Animes of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>Character development was okay but they action was amazing.</p>
<h3>Kiba</h3>
<p>Amira Gal was just a beast in this anime. </p>
<h3>Code Geass</h3>
<p>This should be number one just because of the character development and action was great</p>
